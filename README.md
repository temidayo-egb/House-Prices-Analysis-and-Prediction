In this project, I am a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. Using python language,I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on

## Conclusion

In this analysis, I meticulously handled data preprocessing, including missing value treatment and outlier removal. Feature engineering was enhanced by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features. I explored multiple models and ensured thorough hyperparameter tuning and validation to avoid overfitting.

My evaluation metrics included RMSE, MAE, and RÂ², complemented by visual performance diagnostics. The polynomial plot, optimized through hyperparameter tuning, emerged as the best performer, offering superior predictive accuracy. Meanwhile, the Feature Importance Plot secured second place.

Moving forward, I recommend that :

* The machine learning and AI algorith engineers dive deeper into feature engineering, utilizing advanced ensemble methods, and considering deployment strategies for practical implementation.
